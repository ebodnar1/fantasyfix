                </h3>
                <p class='text-center'>
                    Expected results are calculated by comparing each team's weekly score to every other team's score for that week.
                    The team with the highest score for a week will earn 1 expected wins for that week, since they would have beaten any opponent they would have faced.
                    The team with the lowest score for a week will earn 0 expected wins for that week, since they would have lost to any opponent they would have faced.
                    The expected wins are summed for all completed weeks and compared to each team's actual net wins (wins + half credit to losses), which
                    yields the wins above expected value shown. A positive value for wins above expected means a team is getting lucky in their matchups
                    and exceeding expectations, while a negative value means a team is getting unlucky in their matchups, and should be performing better.

                <p>Team 1 beat Team 2, earning 1 win. However, Team 1 had the second most points in the league this week, 
                    earning an expected win total of 0.66, since they would have beaten two of the three other teams in the league. 
                    This gives Team 1 +0.33 wins above expected, since they would not have won every single possible matchup.
                    Team 3, with the highest number of points, earned the win and 1 expected wins, making their wins above expected 0.
                    Team 4 would have beaten Team 2, but was unluckily matched up with Team 3. For this, they earned 0 wins, 
                    but 0.33 expected wins (would have beaten 1 of 3 other teams), thus giving them -0.33 wins above expected.

                    Team 1 beats Team 4 with the most points in the league, earning 1 win and expected wins. 
                    Team 4 and Team 2 both finish with 20 points, tied for second most in the league. This means they would have
                    beaten one possible opponent (Team 3), lost to another (Team 1), and tied the last possible opponent. This gives
                    them each 0.5 expected wins. Team 4, who lost but earned 0.5 expected wins, has -0.5 wins above expected this week, while
                    Team 2 is the opposite.

                    Team 2 earned 0.5 wins above expected, meaning they have also been slightly lucky in their matchups so far.
                    Team 3 has performed exactly to expectation, earning 1 win and expected win. 
                    Finally, Team 4 has been unlucky, earning 0 wins but 0.83 expected wins, resulting in -0.83 wins above expected.
